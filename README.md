# macro_pad_v1
A 3D printed 9-key mechanical macropad with custom PCB which assists to consolidate workflow and increase functionality through custom programmable key (and mouse) inputs. 
The project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico running circuitPython.


The code developed for the macropad include:
    - Numpad
    - Keypad-controlled mouse
    - Media control pad
    - Pin testing (for use during assembly, debugging after soldering)


BOM:
  1 x Raspberry Pi Pico
  9 x Cherry / Gateron Switches
  1 x Macropad PCB
  1 x 3D Printed Plate (switch locator & Pico cover)
  9 x keycaps (3D printed or otherwise)
  4 x M3 Machine Screws
  4 x M3 Nuts
  4 x Rubber adhesive pads


All CAD files, GERBER files and code is available for download, manufacturing and
